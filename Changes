Revision history for Image-DecodeQR-WeChat

0.01	2022-03-09/19:00
	First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
	Tests include checking for multiple QR codes in same image,
	and supports utf8 filenames and utf8 payloads.
	Note that for some images OpenCV's code crashes.
	Small QR codes or fuzzy ones. Avoid them.
	QR codes less than 55x55 px may have problems.
	Thank you OpenCV and WeChat.

0.2	2022-03-11/17:50
	Fixed pod in WeChat.pm

0.3	2022-03-11/18:30
	Added more tests for rotated QR codes.
	Fixes and additions to the documentation.

0.4	2022-03-14/19:02
	Made the OpenCV detection more robust to hopefully
	deal with systems without pkg-config.
	The added method is cmake-based which is OpenCV's
	preferred method of detecting compilation parameters.
	Hopefully OpenCV binaries installed on M$-windows
	will also include a cmake executable. If neither cmake
	nor pkg-config are present, then we fallback on ENV vars
	specified by user during 'perl Makefile.PL'.
	Added checks for whether OpenCV installation supports
	graphical output (highgui, imshow()) and supports showing
	the results in a window. This will hopefully
	avoid compilation errors because imshow() is undefined.
	Added checks for neutralising the 'graphicaldisplayresult'
	option if highgui is not supported. These are C functions.

0.5	2022-03-15/01:40
	Added some more module dependencies to Makefile.PL.
	Fixed some errors in script/image-decodeqr-wechat.pl.

0.6	2022-03-15/19:30
	Bummer! Sorry CPAN.

0.7	2022-03-15/19:31
	Fixed a problem with wechat_qr_decode_lib.cpp it should
	included the highgui.hpp only if HAS_HIGHGUI==1

0.8	2022-03-16/19:30
	Fixed a problem with using cmake to detect OpenCV.

0.9	2022-03-17/20:00
	A problem arose when calling decode_xs() with an array
	of 6 scalars rather than 6 scalars. Both should work AFAIC.
	Having PROTOTYPES: ENABLE in xs code caught this and complained.
	I have fixed it with specifying explicitly the prototype using
	PROTOTYPE: @ (without this, xsubp produces a '$$$$$$' prototype).
	Added a test case to test this.

1.0	2024-03-07/14:14
	Added 'META_MERGE' key in Makefile.PL
        Modified clean target in Makefile.PL to clean auto-generated .bs and .o files.
        Added dependency 'Test2::Plugin::UTF8' for testing without 'Wide character in print ...' messages
        Test t/20-decode_xs-without-use-utf8.t was judged pointless and was removed -- its job is done by t/10-decode_xs.t.
        Documentation enchancments.

2.0     2024-03-08/23:00
        Major change: replaced sub names 'decode' with 'detect_and_decode_qr' : reason was that decode() clashes with Encode::decode().
        Major change: replaced sub names 'decode_xs' with 'detect_and_decode_qr_xs'.
        Major change: output files are now in XML and JPEG formats.
        Added more tests.
        Enhnaced the highgui detection procedure with 2 more methods.
        Replaced CPAN Ratings link in POD with a link to PerlMonks' Module Review in order to settle issue https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=147894
        Documentation enchancments.

2.1     2024-03-12/11:50
        Documentation fixes.

2.2     2024-09-20/23:00
        Made test filenames more descriptive and fixed some test file messages.
